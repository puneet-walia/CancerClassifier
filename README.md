## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Streamlit

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### Usage

Train the skin cancer classification model by running the provided Jupyter Notebook or script.

Deploy the Streamlit app locally for testing:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Model Details

The skin cancer classification model uses a pre-trained ResNet-50 model with fine-tuned layers for the task. The model achieves high accuracy in classifying benign and malignant skin lesions.

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Especially for the streamlit app interface
